	<h1>Macau</h1>
	<br />
	<p>Macau is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, known as the "Vegas of the East" for its booming gambling and tourism, a legacy from its history as a Portuguese colony until 1999, offering a unique blend of Chinese and European cultures, distinct cuisine, and landmarks like Senado Square and the Macau Tower. It operates under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, maintaining high autonomy, its own currency (Macanese pataca), legal system, and police force, with Cantonese and Portuguese as official languages. </p>
